## How to use it

Open the python notebook with colab by clicking this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/albertoxamin/telegram-deep-fakes-bot/blob/master/deep_fake_telegram.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
And follow the instructions on the notebook

## Enabled users

You can change the enabled users by simply adding your Telegram ID(not username or name, but ID) to the `enabled` array.

For example:

`enabled =[12345678,12344321]`

here we have enabled two users, `12345678` and `12344321`.

If this array is empty, everyone can use your bot (for testing purposes, we decided to set it like that).
